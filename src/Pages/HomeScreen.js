     <p><b>This is a personal training App </b></p>
     <p>A Personal Trainer company needs front end app for their customer database. Database contains <br/>
        info about customers and their trainings. They have REST API and documentation that contains <br/>
        all information needed for front end development.
        So, through this App, I have created a front end for them using either React.js. <br/>
        Through this program, one can add, edit, delete customers. Also, can delete Trainings.<br/>
        Customers can also add trainings.
        There is also calendar provided along with the statistics of the activities. <br/>
        This app was built using Material UI, Material Table UI, Lodash, react-big-calendar, recharts.   <br/>      
        
     </p>
 
    </div>

export default HomeScreen;
